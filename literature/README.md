# Literature

The HRS was designed for research. Thus, many of the features that I think we'll need to engineer for our models should be guided by academic research (I don't think we should create those features randomly ;)). 

**When you get the chance, please read the "Assessment of Cognition Using Surveys and Neuropsychological Assessment: The HRS & ADAMS" paper (Crimmins 2011) that I've uploaded.** I think this paper provides a nice guideline for thinking about and building our baseline model. Of course, our model will be different from their model (and I think we can do a better job than they did), but the paper should give you a good idea of where we'll be starting. 

As we all become more familar with the data (and start to build upon on our baseline model), please keep in mind the following:
1) what are other important factors that affect our brain health (I'm still doing more research about this)
2) how does the HRS measure those factors
3) how should we engineer those factors (based on academic literature)

I'll continue to update this file and share what I find once I have more information. Stay tuned!
